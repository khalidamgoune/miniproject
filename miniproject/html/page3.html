	    		<h2>Targeted marketing</h2>
	    		<p>With access to such a wealth of customer data and an opportunity to keep an eye on customer buying habits as well as the emerging industry trends, eCommerce businesses can stay agile and shape their marketing efforts to provide a better-tailored experience and find more new customers. Just consider for a moment that you have a chance to address thousands of your customers by their first name; that is something already.</p>
                <h2>Serving niche markets</h2>
                 Running a niche brick-and-mortar business can be tough. Scaling a niche product to become popular is effortful. By tapping into a global market, on the other hand, eCommerce retailers can build a highly profitable niche business without any further investment. Using online search capabilities, customers from any corner of the world can find and purchase your products.
                <h2>Working from anywhere</h2>
                <p> Often, running an eCommerce business means that you donâ€™t need to sit in an office from 9 to 5 or suffer through a commute day-in and day-out. A laptop and a good internet connection is all it takes to manage your business from anywhere in the world.</p>
